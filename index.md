Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Jane Han](https://github.com/han-jane/han-jane.github.io/edit/master/index.md){:target="_blank"}, a Cognitive Neuroscience PhD student.

I am now in [Haxby Lab](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/haxbylab/), advised by Professor [James V. Haxby](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UH9yVLwAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} at Psychological Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College. My current research interest is how we could understand and improve the learning process by using fMRI data using naturalistic stimuli and applying the hyperalignment method.

I earned my M.E. in Biomedical Engineering and B.A. in Psychology and English Literature at Sungkyunkwan University. At [Center for Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Research Center](https://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/){:target="_blank"}, I investigated how the brain representation of visual perception is affected by top-down cognition, specifically interpretation of the scene, advised by Professor [Won Mok Shim](http://wshimlab.com/people/){:target="_blank"}.
